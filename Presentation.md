# Exploratory data analysis
## auto data set
Let's start with looking at the auto data set first, and view the summary:

```r

```

The price seems to be centered around the lower prices, with the 3rd quartile being listed at 11 000 EUR. Let's take look at how the prices are distributed.

```r
hist(auto$price)
```

![Histogram of price in the auto data set](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27180592-78ab19f4-51d4-11e7-904b-bf489ab57c0a.png)

The plot confirms that the majority of cars are below 10 000 EUR, and that there are gradually fewer and fewer cars with higher prices. Let's now look at the mileage of the cars.

```r
hist(auto$kilometer)
```

![Histogram of kilometers in the auto data set](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27180709-f7e8b212-51d4-11e7-8c62-e997d79e236e.png)

There seems to be something strange going on with the variable. To look at bit more closely, let's try a density plot.
```r
ggplot(auto, aes(kilometer)) +
  geom_density(fill = "lightcyan")
```

![ggplot auto aes kilometer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27180905-9bf885f8-51d5-11e7-98ec-04cde41c3c15.png)

It seems like the kilometer variable is in bins, which means kilometers is rounded to some numbers. Two - there is an incredibly high number of cars that have registered with 150 000 kilometers compared to the other bins. This is likely because the data is truncated, that is, values over 150 000 km is combined with those in the 150 000 km group.

To be absolutely certain there is binning in the kilometer data, let's find the unique kilometer values.
```r
table(auto$kilometer)

5000  10000  20000  30000  40000  50000  60000  70000  80000  90000 100000 125000 150000
1591   1433   4273   4930   5524   6398   7185   7698   8368   9078  10580  24020 101943
```

This confirms that the kilometer variable is saved in bins. I suspect that the high number of 150 000 km cars reflect that these are older cars. This makes sense since the car prices that are usually below 10 000 EUR. Let's confirm this now.
```r
hist(auto$yearOfRegistration[auto$kilometer == 150000])
```

![Histogram of registration year for cars that have driven 150 000 km](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27181078-47f7d8a4-51d6-11e7-9ce8-4b81de6d3a88.png)

We can see that among the cars that have registered 150 000 km, most of them are older, with fewer and fewer cars that have driven that far for each year we get closer to 2017.


Let's now look at the different car types - how are they different?
```r
ggplot(auto, aes(price, yearOfRegistration, col = vehicleType)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.01) +
  geom_smooth(se = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~vehicleType)
```

![plot of car types according to price and registration year](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27181190-c0cb6b92-51d6-11e7-9a6f-fec9bb35ccb3.png)

We can see that there are some interesting patterns here. First off, the semi-transparent dots allow us to see the spread in prices, and where there are a lot of similarly-priced cars. We can see that hatchbacks typically cost less, and that the spread is quite small. The sedan-class has a wider spread than the other car types, which is hardly surprising, as there's a wider range of sedans.

One particular issue we can see from this plot is the "upward-tail" at the lower price ranges that are particularly noticeable for hatchbacks and SUVs. This seems to come from a high number of cars for lease, and they are typically newer.

A final point I found interesting is that there seems to be a sharper downward shift in interest for convertibles after the financial crisis. If one compares it to hatchbacks, you can se how the curve has a much sharper bend around 2010.


## reliability data set
Let's now move on to the reliability data set. We'll start off with a summary:
```r
summary(rel)

        brand          model        car_prod_y    report_year     fault_rate       mileage          car_age         nationality

 opel      : 342   a4     :  51   Max.   :2015   Max.   :2017   Max.   :45.10   Max.   :197500   Max.   :11.000                  
 (Other)   :3556   (Other):5628                                                                                                  
```

We see that the report years are between 2013 and 2017, with car production years between 2002 and 2015. Each report has 2 to 11 years old cars, so these numbers match up. The fault rate is between 2.1% and a crazy 45.1%.

Let's start by looking at how many observations we have for each car brand:
```r
table(rel$brand)

alfa romeo       audi        bmw  chevrolet   chrysler    citroen      dacia   daihatsu       fiat       ford 
        81        295        304        112         15        342         69         15        200        412 
     honda    hyundai        kia      mazda   mercedes       mini mitsubishi     nissan       opel    peugeot 
       194        213        191        255        391         59         83        148        342        186 
   porsche    renault       seat      skoda      smart     subaru     suzuki     toyota volkswagen      volvo 
        72        350        167        183         51         32        158        330        624        143 
```

How does the fault rate vary across the different brands?
```r
ggplot(rel, aes(car_age, fault_rate, col = nationality), legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~nationality) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
  
ggplot(rel, aes(car_age, fault_rate, col = nationality), legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

![plot car age fault rate brand](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27182099-7a30c05c-51da-11e7-907f-b9738b668b81.png)

When we compare the different brand's fault rates across years, we see that there are some big differences. Look at how Mini and Porsche differs. Porsche has lower than half of the expected fault rate when the cars are 11 years old.

Let's break it down by mileage as well.
```r
ggplot(rel, aes(mileage/1000, fault_rate, col = brand), legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~brand) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

![plot mileage fault rate brand](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27182033-2c15e4e2-51da-11e7-956a-65a6a9d4f18f.png)

Now we see part of the reason why Porsche does so well - it appears that they aren't driven as far as a lot of  the other brands. Porsches are luxury cars after all, it makes sense that they are driven less. But Mini still compares poorly against the Japanese brands, for instance. Could it be that the nationality of the cars are an important factor?
```r
ggplot(rel, aes(car_age, fault_rate, col = nationality), legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~nationality) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')

ggplot(rel, aes(car_age, fault_rate, col = nationality), legend = FALSE) +
 Â geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

![plot car age fault rate nationality1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27182554-db38256a-51db-11e7-8530-3bc56495b23f.png)

When we focus on age, it seems the Japanese and German cars have a lower fault rate, but after about five years, the Japanese cars have even lower fault rates than the German cars. French cars have a reputation for not being the most reliable - it seems this data supports that notion.

```r
ggplot(rel, aes(mileage/1000, fault_rate, col = nationality), legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~nationality) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')

ggplot(rel, aes(mileage/1000, fault_rate, col = nationality), legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

![plot mileage fault rate nationality1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27182618-2557081e-51dc-11e7-9ea8-f0f9c1f77541.png)

![plot mileage fault rate nationality2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27182627-2e1638c6-51dc-11e7-902d-7c5b117b73f9.png)

When we focus on mileage, the German cars have the lowest fault rates for the most part. We can also see here that many of the German cars are driven further than the Japanese cars. This might explain in part why the German fault rates are higher when just age is accounted for.


## crash rating data set
Let's start off with a summary of the data set.
```r
summary(crash)

        brand         model         stars       model_y_start   model_y_end     nationality      y_mean

 volkswagen: 32   megane :  5   1st Qu.:4.000   1st Qu.:2004   1st Qu.:2010   german  :112   1st Qu.:2007  
 ford      : 28   5      :  4   Median :5.000   Median :2009   Median :2017   japanese: 90   Median :2012  
 citroen   : 25   c      :  4   Mean   :4.372   Mean   :2008   Mean   :2013   others  :191   Mean   :2011  
 mercedes  : 24   passat :  4   3rd Qu.:5.000   3rd Qu.:2013   3rd Qu.:2017                  3rd Qu.:2015  
 kia       : 23   6      :  3   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :2016   Max.   :2017                  Max.   :2016  
 (Other)   :306   (Other):445   
```

After the cleaning, we see that the model years overlap nicely with the other data sets.

The crash test scores show that most cars get a very good safety rating. More than half of the cars got five stars, according to the median of five stars.

Let's look closer at the crash ratings.

```r
ggplot(crash, aes(stars, y_mean, col = brand), legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~brand) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

![plot stars y_mean brand](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26480394/27182808-d1dd870c-51dc-11e7-9dfb-a3dd3a31c7ed.png)

Here is the stars-rating plotted against the middle of the production run of each car, shown by brand. Most seem to have a pattern that goes up to the right in the graphs, which indicates that as newer cars come to market, they also achieve a better crash test score.

We can also see that those few brands that have only five star ratings, tend to only have recent car models.
